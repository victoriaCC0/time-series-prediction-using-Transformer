# time-series-prediction-using-Transformer
Use two different transformer-based architecture to make time series prediction and compare the performance with the conventional model ARIMA
## The structure of the real-life time series data prediction 
The following is a solution to the issue of staffing optimisation in retail businesses. The traditional time series prediction model ARIMA is used to provide the baseline for the forecasting after cleaning and standardising real-world data. Then, based on the fundamental property of the transformer’s self-attention mechanism, a simplified version of the transformer is developed and compared to the ARIMA model. Additionally, a transformer with a more complex architectural design is created to analyse the effect on the performance of the prediction. One important aspect of time- series prediction is the number of previous time steps used as input variables, therefore two distinct values of ”window size” are trained to see which one performs better.
